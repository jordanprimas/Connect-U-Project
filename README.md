# Connect-U-Project 
[View Demo](https://youtu.be/5fOqXF_yU9w)
A social media application that allows users to create their own account, publish posts, and join groups with other users with similar interests. 

## About the Project
Connect-U-Project is a full-stack application utilizing Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

### Backend 
The backend is built with Flask, providing a simple REST API using the Flask-RESTful extension for routes defined in `app.py`. It uses several Flask extensions:

* **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** An ORM for defining models and querying table data in `models.py`.
* **Flask-Migrate:** Manages schema migrations.
* **SQLAlchemy-Serializer:** Serializes database models into dictionaries, including or excluding attributes to prevent recursion issues in nested data.
* **Flask-Bcrypt:** Provides hashing abilities for password protection.
* **Flask-Authlib-Client:** Implements Google OAuth2, allowing users to log in/sign up using a Google account.

### Frontend

The frontend is developed using React to create an interactive and dynamic user experience. React Router DOM is used for client side routing configuration and navigation. This library enables the application to handle navigation between different pages seamlessly, without requiring full page reloads, enhancing the user experience by providing smooth transitions and maintaining state across the application.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of this project up and running follow these simple steps. 

### Prerequisites
* pip: If you have Homebrew installed you can use:

  ```brew install python```

* pyenv

  ```curl https://pyenv.run | bash```

* pipenv 

  ```pip install pipenv```

* npm: If you have Homebrew installed you can use:

  ```brew install node```

### Installation
1. **Backend Setup:**

* The project contains a default `Pipfile` with the necessary dependencies.To download the dependencies for the backend server, run:

```sh
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

* Run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by running:

```sh
python server/app.py
```

2. **Frontend Setup:** 
* The `package.json` file has been configured with common React application dependencies, including `react-router-dom`. It also sets the `proxy` field to forward requests to `"http://localhost:5555"`.

* To download the dependencies for the frontend client, run:

```sh
npm install --prefix client
```

* Run React app on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

## Usage
### Basic Functionality

Connect-U allows users to:
* Create an account
